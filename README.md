# WinampSerialControl
Control Winamp using Arduino Mega

Hi,
This is a small project I was working on from a bit of time.
Due my work and overall daily life, despite I'm a SW engineer this code has no style nor any optimization at all.
It is more of a frankenstein given that I went and looked in google for everything that I needed for it to work.

It, however, is heavily based on the work of 
Joe Golden and Kenny McNutt
Whose work can be found at
https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/s2004/km279/Copy%20of%20ece476/intro.html

Given that after all I based my work on theirs and I do not see any sort of license at all, I decided that I should share the code as well
(But it is ugly and you have been warned)

Arduino contains the sketch file for the Arduino Mega.
Project contains a c++ project which compiles the plugin that goes inside the winamp plugin folder.

Some images of the project can be seen here:

As well as a video of it working:

I have choosen winamp as I still prefer it compared to other players (but foobar is really really awesome)
and works wonders in windows 10 even with the plugin here, and the fact that there is a matrix plugin for 5.1 devices is just nice.

Well then, enjoy! Hope it is of help.
